In this post, you will learn how to write the Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java. Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as “Noughts and Crosses” in some regions, is an iconic and timeless two-player game that has been captivating players of all ages for generations. This simple yet engaging game is played on a 3×3 grid, and its objective is to form a line of three matching symbols (either ‘X’ or ‘O’) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Despite its apparent simplicity, Tic-Tac-Toe involves critical thinking, strategy, and anticipation, making it a perfect pastime for players of all skill levels.

A Quick Recap of the Rules:
Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a square grid, usually 3×3, where two players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols – ‘X’ for one player and ‘O’ for the other.
The first player to create a row, column, or diagonal of three matching symbols wins the game.
If all cells are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

Gameplay Overview:
The game begins with an empty grid, and the first player, traditionally using ‘X,’ starts by placing their symbol in any vacant cell.
The second player, using ‘O,’ then makes their move, and the turns continue to alternate until a winner is declared or a draw is reached.
